# Conquest

Conquest was an RTS Minecraft server which I used to run back in 2013. The goal of Conquest was to completely rewrite the game play from the ground up. There was no mining, no crafting, no health, no mobs. It wasn't Minecraft, but a new game mode entirely.

In it's current state, this source code is imported directly as it was compiled on July 15th, 2013, for Minecraft 1.5.2. The opening day of the server.

This code was written when I was still pretty new to coding, to it's full to the brim with bugs, glitches, and some of the most terrifying spaghetti code you'll ever lay your eyes on. This is being uploaded for historical purposes mostly. I may try to update the code to be stable enough to release on a modern version of Minecraft, but don't expect much, lol.
