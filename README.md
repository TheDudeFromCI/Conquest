# Conquest

Conquest was an RTS Minecraft server which I used to run back in 2013. The goal of Conquest was to completely rewrite the game play from the ground up. There was no mining, no crafting, no health, no mobs. It wasn't Minecraft, but a new game mode entirely.

In it's current state, this source code is imported directly as it was compiled on July 15th, 2013, for Minecraft 1.5.2. The opening day of the server.

This code was written when I was still pretty new to coding, to it's full to the brim with bugs, glitches, and some of the most terrifying spaghetti code you'll ever lay your eyes on. This is being uploaded for historical purposes mostly. I may try to update the code to be stable enough to release on a modern version of Minecraft, but don't expect much, lol.

This project is imcomplete, sadly. While all the code is here, all configuration files, wiki pages, and help documents, were lost to time. However, the build map was successfully recovered. (original player.dat files have been removed for privacy reasons) Due to the large file size of the build map, it is impractical to upload both the original map and the newest version of the map without massively increasing the size of this repo. As such, only the updated (MC 1.15.2) version of the build map will be uploaded here. With one of the goals if this project being to modernize Conquest, listing the up to date version of the map makes the most sense.

I hope you find this project an enjoyable experience through lost history and nostalgia like I do. Have a wonderful day.
